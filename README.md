# Python-online-grocery-store
An analysis of orders, prizes and customer segments of an online grocery store with Python.

This is a student project I did in my data analytics bootcamp. Using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn) I

- did data consistency checks
- merged and exported dataframes
- derived new variables using if-statements, user-defined functions, loc()-functions and for-loops
- created flags
- created summary columns (descriptive statistics) using groupby()
- analyzed order behavior of different customer groups
- plotted charts (histograms, bar-charts, scatterplots, line-charts)
